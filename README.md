# jQuery-and-map-filter-reduce
Contains jQuery programs using ajax functions and jQuery Promises to perform various operations involving forex trading. Eg: Creating and order, getting its ID and closing the trade after waiting for 5 seconds. I have made use of sequential(queue) execution in asynchronous functions like ajax and Promises to escape from the callback hell.
Also, uses higher order functions like map(),filter() and reduce() to traverse arrays in a more efficent manner than the classic for() loop.
